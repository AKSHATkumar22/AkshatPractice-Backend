***POINTS TO REMEMBER***


1. Always remember that while using anything you need to use ***ARROW FUNCTION***


2. Always remember using const variable, for declaring variable, because we can declare again and again.


3. We always keep the ***UseState*** function either empty, null or the boolean for any ***Upgradation***.


4. App.get for getting the value, App.res for response of the value, App.req for the request from the server, App.listen for listening the function call into the production.



5. With the help of ***AXIOS*** we can declare or show the Array from the backend and push it to the frontend server.



6.  ***PROXY*** used for the creative routes calls,


7.  ***CORS*** also Know has cross origin where it also means that you have used the wrong origin path, so use the correct origin and then connect the backend server with frontend server.
